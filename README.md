# Measured [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/measured.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/measured) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/measured.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/measured)

Encapsulates measurements with their units. Provides easy conversion between units.

Lightweight and easily extensible to include other units and conversions. Conversions done with `Rational` for precision.

The adapter to integrate `measured` with Ruby on Rails is in a separate [`measured-rails`](https://github.com/Shopify/measured-rails) gem.

## Installation

Using bundler, add to the Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'measured'
```

Or stand alone:

```
$ gem install measured
```

## Usage

Initialize a measurement:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.new("12", "g")
> #<Measured::Weight: 12 #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>>
```

Convert to return a new measurement:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.new("12", "g").convert_to("kg")
> #<Measured::Weight: 0.012 #<Measured::Unit: kg (kilogram, kilograms) 1000/1 g>>
```

Agnostic to symbols/strings:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.new(1, "kg") == Measured::Weight.new(1, :kg)
> true
```

Seamlessly handles aliases:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.new(12, :oz) == Measured::Weight.new("12", :ounce)
> true
```

Raises on unknown units:

```ruby
begin
  Measured::Weight.new(1, :stone)
rescue Measured::UnitError
  puts "Unknown unit"
end
```

Parse from string without having to split out the value and unit first:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.parse("123 grams")
> #<Measured::Weight: 123 #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>>
```

Parse can scrub extra whitespace and split number from unit:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.parse(" 2kg ")
> #<Measured::Weight: 2 #<Measured::Unit: kg (kilogram, kilograms) 1000/1 g>>
```

Perform addition / subtraction against other units, all represented internally as `Rational` or `BigDecimal`:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.new(1, :g) + Measured::Weight.new(2, :g)
> #<Measured::Weight: 3 #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>>
Measured::Weight.new("2.1", :g) - Measured::Weight.new(1, :g)
> #<Measured::Weight: 1.1 #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>>
```

Multiplication and division by units is not supported, but the actual value can be scaled by a scalar:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.new(10, :g).scale(0.5)
> #<Measured::Weight: 5 #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>>
Measured::Weight.new(2, :g).scale(3)
> #<Measured::Weight: 6 #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>>
```

In cases of differing units, the left hand side takes precedence:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.new(1000, :g) + Measured::Weight.new(1, :kg)
> #<Measured::Weight: 2000 #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>>
```

Converts units only as needed for equality comparison:

```ruby
> Measured::Weight.new(1000, :g) == Measured::Weight.new(1, :kg)
true
```

Extract the unit and the value:

```ruby
weight = Measured::Weight.new("1.2", "grams")
weight.value
> #<BigDecimal:7fabf6c1d0a0,'0.12E1',18(18)>
weight.unit
> #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>
```

See all valid units:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.unit_names
> ["g", "kg", "lb", "oz"]
```

Check if a unit is a valid unit or alias:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.unit_or_alias?(:g)
> true
Measured::Weight.unit_or_alias?("gram")
> true
Measured::Weight.unit_or_alias?("stone")
> false
```

See all valid units with their aliases:

```ruby
Measured::Weight.unit_names_with_aliases
> ["g", "gram", "grams", "kg", "kilogram", "kilograms", "lb", "lbs", "ounce", "ounces", "oz", "pound", "pounds"]
```

## Units and conversions

### SI units support

There is support for SI units through the use of `si_unit`. Units declared through it will have automatic support for all SI prefixes:

| Multiplying Factor                | SI Prefix | Scientific Notation   |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 | yotta (Y) | 10^24                 |
| 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000     | zetta (Z) | 10^21                 |
| 1 000 000 000 000 000 000         | exa (E)   | 10^18                 |
| 1 000 000 000 000 000             | peta (P)  | 10^15                 |
| 1 000 000 000 000                 | tera (T)  | 10^12                 |
| 1 000 000 000                     | giga (G)  | 10^9                  |
| 1 000 000                         | mega (M)  | 10^6                  |
| 1 000                             | kilo (k)  | 10^3                  |
| 0.001                             | milli (m) | 10^-3                 |
| 0.000 001                         | micro (Âµ) | 10^-6                 |
| 0.000 000 001                     | nano (n)  | 10^-9                 |
| 0.000 000 000 001                 | pico (p)  | 10^-12                |
| 0.000 000 000 000 001             | femto (f) | 10^-15                |
| 0.000 000 000 000 000 001         | atto (a)  | 10^-18                |
| 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 001     | zepto (z) | 10^-21                |
| 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 001 | yocto (y) | 10^-24                |

### Bundled unit conversion

* `Measured::Weight`
  * g, gram, grams, and all SI prefixes
  * t, metric_ton, metric_tons
  * slug, slugs
  * N, newtons, newton
  * long_ton, long_tons, weight_ton, weight_tons, 'W/T', imperial_ton, imperial_tons, displacement_ton, displacement_tons
  * short_ton, short_tons
  * lb, lbs, pound, pounds
  * oz, ounce, ounces
* `Measured::Length`
  * m, meter, metre, meters, metres, and all SI prefixes
  * in, inch, inches
  * ft, foot, feet
  * yd, yard, yards
  * mi, mile, miles

You can skip these and only define your own units by doing:

```ruby
gem 'measured', require: 'measured/base'
```

### Shortcut syntax

There is a shortcut initialization syntax for modules inside the `Measured` namespace, similar to `BigDecimal(123)` vs `BigDecimal.new(123)`:

```ruby
Measured::Weight(1, :g)
> #<Measured::Weight: 1 #<Measured::Unit: g (gram, grams)>>
```

### Adding new units

Extending this library to support other units is simple. To add a new conversion, use `Measured.build` to define your base unit and conversion units:

```ruby
Measured::Thing = Measured.build do
  unit :base_unit,           # Add a unit to the system
    aliases: [:bu]           # Allow it to be aliased to other names/symbols

  unit :another_unit,        # Add a second unit to the system
    aliases: [:au],          # All units allow aliases, as long as they are unique
    value: ["1.5 bu"]        # The conversion rate to another unit
end
```

All unit names are case sensitive.

Values for conversion units can be defined as a string with two tokens `"number unit"` or as an array with two elements. All values will be parsed as / coerced to `Rational`. Conversion paths don't have to be direct as a conversion table will be built for all possible conversions.

### Namespaces

All units and classes are namespaced by default, but can be aliased in your application.

```ruby
Weight = Measured::Weight
Length = Measured::Length
```

## Alternatives

Existing alternatives which were considered:

### Gem: [ruby-units](https://github.com/olbrich/ruby-units)
* **Pros**
  * Accurate math and conversion factors.
  * Includes nearly every unit you could ask for.
* **Cons**
  * Opens up and modifies `Array`, `Date`, `Fixnum`, `Math`, `Numeric`, `String`, `Time`, and `Object`, then depends on those changes internally.
  * Lots of code to solve a relatively simple problem.
  * No ActiveRecord adapter.

### Gem: [quantified](https://github.com/Shopify/quantified)
* **Pros**
  * Lightweight.
* **Cons**
  * All math done with floats making it highly lossy.
  * All units assumed to be pluralized, meaning using unit abbreviations is not possible.
  * Not actively maintained.
  * No ActiveRecord adapter.

### Gem: [unitwise](https://github.com/joshwlewis/unitwise)
* **Pros**
  * Well written and maintained.
  * Conversions done with Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) so highly accurate and reliable.
* **Cons**
  * Lots of code. Good code, but lots of it.
  * Many modifications to core types.
  * ActiveRecord adapter exists but is written and maintained by a different person/org.
